**Today's Work** : Week 2 in 'Data Visualization With Python' on coursera, visualized data using area plots and other.

## Day3: Oct 20,2018
**Today's Work** : Completed Week 2 in 'Data Visualization With Python' on coursera, visualized data using box plot, scatter plot and bubble plot

## Day4: Oct 21,2018
**Today's Work** : Week 3 in 'Data Visualization With Python' on coursera. Advanced visualization of data using Waffle charts and Word Clouds. Explored Seaborn library and made regression plots with it. Visualizing Geospatial Data using Folium and Choropleth Maps. Also, completed 2/4 tasks of week 3 final assignment.

## Day5: Oct 22,2018
**Today's Work** :Earned Certification In 'Data Visualization With Python' By IBM on coursera. Completed peer-graded assignment comprising of 4 tasks. Started Course 8 (Machine Learning With Python) of 9 in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Specialization.

## Day6: Oct 23,2018
**Today's Work** : Completed Week 1 and started Week 2 In 'Machine Learning With Python' By IBM on Coursera, learned about Simple Linear Regression, Model Evaluation In Linear Regression and Evaluation Metrics in Linear Regression. Implemented Simple Linear Regression on predicting the CO2 Emission of Cars using Sci-kit learn and Visualized the Regression Fit Line.

## Day7: Oct 24,2018
**Today's Work** : Completed Week 2 In 'Machine Learning With Python' By IBM on Coursera, learned about Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Linear Regression and Non-Linear Regression. Implemented Multiple, Polynomial and Non-Linear Regression, used the Sigmoid/Logistic model to fit the data and found the Optimized Parameter using Scipy's Optimization Library (Curve_Fit for non-linear).

## Day8: Oct 25,2018
**Today's Work** : Week 3 In 'Machine Learning With Python' By IBM on Coursera, learned about Classification, types of Classification, got to know about different Models used for Classfication. Learned about K-Nearest Neighbor Model for Classification, implemented Multiclass Classification Problem for a Telecommunication company using KNN. Ran the model for different values of 'K' and picked the Optimal one on the basisc of Accuracy Score (Sort Of Jaccard Index Score) for each 'K', computed the Standard Deviation for each Accuracy Score. Plotted the result Accuracy Score values with respect to Standard Deviation for each Score.

## Day9: Oct 26,2018
**Today's Work** : Week 3 In 'Machine Learning With Python' By IBM on Coursera. Learned about Decision Tree Model in Classification and Implemented it on Binary Classification problem for Drug Recommendation.

## Day10: Oct 27,2018
**Today's Work** : Week 3 In 'Machine Learning With Python' By IBM on Coursera. Learned about Logistic Regression for Classification. Learned about Metrics used for Evaluation of the model like Confusion-Matrix, Log-Loss, Jaccard-Similarity-Score etc. Learned about the parameter 'C' and 'Solver' worked with differnet values for 'C' and 'Solver'. Implemented Logistic Regression on a hypothetical Communication Company named Churn by using the scikit leaern LogisticRegression model for C=1 and solver='newton-cg' whereas the model was efficient for parameters C=0.01 and solver='liblinear' which produced logloss 0.60 and 0.25 respectively.

## Day11: Oct 28,2018
**Today's Work** : Week 3 Completed In 'Machine Learning With Python' By IBM on Coursera. Learned about Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for Classification. Learned about what 'Kernel' is and impletemented SVM model for 2 different Kernels. This Classification model was impletementd on data about Patients being Benign or Malignant.

## Day12: Oct 29,2018
**Today's Work** : Week 4 In 'Machine Learning With Python' By IBM on Coursera. Intorduction to Clustering and different types of Clustering. Understanding about Clustering as Unsupervised Machine Learning technique. Leaned about K-Means Clustering Algorithm that falls in Partion Clustering type. Implemented K-Means Clustering model on random data and then for Customer Segmentation based on their Demographical Data.
